. open the firewall to have access to ports 80, 443 and 6443 or 16443 from your client machine
. xref:configure.adoc[configure] the DNS name for the server and choose the services you want to enable 

== Installation

If the prerequisites are satisfied, execute the  dommand:

----
nuv setup server <server> <user>

[IMPORTANT]
====
Replace in the command before `<server>` with the IP address or DNS name used to access the server, and `<user>` with the username you have to use to access the server
