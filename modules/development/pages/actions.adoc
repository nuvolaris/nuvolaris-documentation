== Actions

Actions are stateless functions that run on the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform. For
example, an action can be used to detect the faces in an image, respond
to a database change, respond to an API call, or post a Tweet. In
general, an action is invoked in response to an event and produces some
observable output.

An action may be created from a function programmed using a number of
xref:index-runtimes.adoc[supported languages and runtimes], or from
a binary-compatible executable.

* The Nuvolaris CLI makes it easy to create and invoke actions. Instructions for configuring and using the CLI are available xref:cli:index.adoc[here].
* You can also use the xref:rest_api.adoc[REST API].

While the actual function code will be specific to a
xref:index-runtimes.adoc[language and runtime], the
operations to create, invoke and manage an action are the same
regardless of the implementation choice. 

We recommend that you review xref:cli:index.adoc[the cli] and read xref:tutorial:index.adoc[the tutorial] before moving on to advanced topics.


=== What you need to know about actions

* Functions should be stateless, or _idempotent_. While the system does
not enforce this property, there is no guarantee that any state
maintained by an action will be available across invocations. In some
cases, deliberately leaking state across invocations may be advantageous
for performance, but also exposes some risks.
* An action executes in a sandboxed environment, namely a container. At
any given time, a single activation will execute inside the container.
Subsequent invocations of the same action may reuse a previous
container, and there may exist more than one container at any given
time, each having its own state.
* Invocations of an action are not ordered. If the user invokes an
action twice from the command line or the REST API, the second
invocation might run before the first. If the actions have side effects,
they might be observed in any order.
* There is no guarantee that actions will execute atomically. Two
actions can run concurrently and their side effects can be interleaved.
OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris does not ensure any particular concurrent consistency model
for side effects. Any concurrency side effects will be
implementation-dependent.
* Actions have two phases: an initialization phase, and a run phase.
During initialization, the function is loaded and prepared for
execution. The run phase receives the action parameters provided at
invocation time. Initialization is skipped if an action is dispatched to
a previously initialized container — this is referred to as a _warm
start_. You can tell if an
invocation was a warm activation or a cold one requiring initialization by inspecting
the activation record.

* An action runs for a bounded amount of time. This limit can be
configured per action, and applies to both the initialization and the
execution separately. If the action time limit is exceeded during the
initialization or run phase, the activation’s response status is _action
developer error_.

=== Accessing action metadata within the action body

The action environment contains several properties that are specific to
the running action. These allow the action to programmatically work with
OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris assets via the REST API, or set an internal alarm when the
action is about to use up its allotted time budget. The properties are
accessible via the system environment for all supported runtimes:
Node.js, Python, Swift, Java and Docker actions when using the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris
Docker skeleton.

* `__OW_API_HOST` the API host for the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris deployment running this
action.
* `__OW_API_KEY` the API key for the subject invoking the action, this
key may be a restricted API key. This property is absent unless requested with the annotation
explicitly xref:annotations.adoc#provide-api-key[`provide-api-key`] 
* `__OW_NAMESPACE` the namespace for the _activation_ (this may not be
the same as the namespace for the action).
* `__OW_ACTION_NAME` the fully qualified name of the running action.
* `__OW_ACTION_VERSION` the internal version number of the running
action.
* `__OW_ACTIVATION_ID` the activation id for this running action
instance.
* `__OW_DEADLINE` the approximate time when this action will have
consumed its entire duration quota (measured in epoch milliseconds).
