= Developer Guide

Welcome to Nuvolaris Developer guide. 

Nuvolaris is based on link:https://openwhisk.apache.org[Apache OpenWhisk] and the documentation in this section is derived for the official OpenWhisk documentation.

In this sections we mostly document how to write xref:actions.adoc[**actions** (functions)], the building blocks of OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris applications. There are also a few related entities for managing actions (packages, parameters etc) you also need to know.

You can write actions in a number of programming languages.  Nuvolaris supports directly xref:index-runtimes.adoc[this list of programming languages]. The list is expanding over the time.

See below for documentation related to:

* xref:index-entities.adoc[Nuvolaris and OpenWhisk Entities]  
* xref:index-runtimes.adoc[Nuvolaris Runtimes]
* xref:index-references[Reference material].


There is also a xref:actions-actionloop.adoc[tutorial and a development kit] to build your own runtime for your favorite programming language.
