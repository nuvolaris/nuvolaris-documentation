== Packaging the App

With Nuvolaris you can write a manifest file (in YAML) to have an easy way to deploy applications.

In this last chapter of the tutorial we will package the code to easily deploy the app, both frontend and actions.

=== Start The Manifest File

Let's create a "manifest.yaml" file in the `packages` directory which will be used to describe the actions to deploy:

[source,yaml]
----
packages:
  contact:
    actions:
      notify:
        function: contacts/notify.js
        web: true
        inputs:
          notifications:
            value: $NOTIFICATIONS
----

This is the basic manifest file with just the `notify` action. At the top level we have the standard `packages` keyword, under which we can define the packages we want. Until now we created all of our actions in the `contact` package so we add it under `packages`.

Then under each package, the `actions` keyword is needed so we can add our action custom names with the path to the code (with `function`). Finally we also add `web: true` which is equivalent to `--web true` when creating the action manually.

Finally we used the `inputs` keyword to define the parameters to inject in the function.

If we apply this manifest file (we will see how soon), it will be the same as the previous `nuv action create contact/notify <path-to-notify.js> -p notifications $NOTIFICATIONS --web true`.

=== The Submit Action

The submit action we wrote earlier uses an annotation to inject the api key in the action's environment. The manifest file also supports annotations and it's quite straightforward. Let's define the submit action:

[source,yaml]
----
packages:
  contact:
    actions:
      ...
      submit:
        function: contact/submit.js
        web: true
        annotations:
          provide-api-key: true
----

=== The Database Actions

Similarly to the `notify` and `submit` actions, let's add to the manifest file the two actions for the database. We also need to pass as a package parameter the DB url, so we will use `inputs` key as before, but at the package level:

[source,yaml]
----
packages:
  contact:
    inputs:
      dbUri:
        type: string
        value: $POSTGRES_URL
    actions:
      ...
      write:
        function: contact/write.js
        web: true

      create-table:
        function: contact/create-table.js
        annotations:
          autoexec: true
----

Note the `create-table` action does not have the `web` set to true as it is not needed to be exposed to the world. Instead it just has the annotation for cron scheduler.

=== The Submit->Notify Sequence

Lastly, we created a sequence with `submit` and `notify` that we have to specify it in the manifest file as well.

[source,yaml]
----
packages:
  contact:
    inputs:
      ...

    actions:
      ...

    sequences:
      submit-notify:
        actions: submit, notify
----

We just have to add the `sequences` key at the `contact` level (next to `actions`) and define the sequences we want with the available actions. 

== Deployment

The final version of the manifest file is:

[source,yaml]
----
packages:
  contact:
    inputs:
      dbUri:
        type: string
        value: $POSTGRES_URL
    actions:
      notify:
        function: contact/notify.js
        web: true
        inputs:
          notifications:
            value: $NOTIFICATIONS

      submit:
        function: contact/submit.js
        web: true
        annotations:
          provide-api-key: true

      write:
        function: contact/write.js
        web: true

      create-table:
        function: contact/create-table.js
        annotations:
          autoexec: true

    sequences:
      submit-notify:
        actions: submit, notify
        web: true
----

`nuv` comes equipped with a handy command to deploy an app: `nuv project deploy`.

It checks if there is a `packages` folder with inside a manifest file and deploys all the specified actions. Then it checks if there is a `web` folder and uploads it to the platform. 

It does all what we did manually until now in one command.

So, from the top level directory of our app let's run (let's also set the input env var):

[source, bash]
----
export POSTGRES_URL=<your-postgres-url>
export NOTIFICATIONS=<the-webhook>

nuv project deploy

Packages and web directory present.
Success: Deployment completed successfully.
Found web directory. Uploading..
----

With just this command you deployed all the actions (and sequences) and uploaded the frontend (from the web folder).
