= Provision a Linux server in Amazon Web Services

You can provision a server suitable to install Nuvolaris in cloud provider https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services] xref:download.adoc[nuv] as follows: 

. install `aws`, the <<install-cli, AWS CLI>>
. get <<get-credentials, Access and Secret Key>>
. <<configure, configure AWS>>
. <<provision, provision a server>>
. retrieve the <<retrieve-ip, ip address>> to configure a DNS name

Once you have a Linux server up and running you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring] and xref:install-cluster.adoc[installing Nuvolaris].

[#install-cli]
== Installing the AWS CLI

Our cli `nuv` uses under the hood the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html[AWS CLI version 2], so you need to dowload and install it https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[following those instructions].

Once installed, ensure it is available on the terminal executing the following command:

----
aws --version
----

you should receive something like this:

====
`aws-cli/2.9.4 Python/3.9.11 Linux/5.19.0-1025-aws exe/x86_64.ubuntu.22 prompt/off`
====

Ensure the version is at least 2.

[#get-credentials]
== Getting the Access and Secret key

:create-keys: https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-access-key
:eksctl-permissions: https://eksctl.io/usage/minimum-iam-policies/
 
Next step is to retrieve credentials, in the form of an access key and a secret key.

So you need to: 
* access the AWS console  {create-keys}[following those instructions] create an access key and secret key,  
* give to the credentials the minimum required permissions  {eksctl-permissions}[as described here] to build an EKS cluster.

You will end up with a couple of string as follows:

====
Sample AWS Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
Sample AWS Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
====

Take note of them as you need them for configuring out CLI.

[#configure]
== Configure AWS to provision a server

Before you can provision a Linux server you have to configure AWS typing the command:

----
nuv config aws
----

The system will then ask the following questions:

----
*** Please, specify AWS Access Id and press enter.
AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
*** Please, specify AWS Secret Key and press enter.
wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
*** Please, specify AWS Region to use and press enter.
To get a list of valid values use:
  aws ec2 describe-regions --output table

Just press enter for default [us-east-1]: 

*** Please, specify AWS public SSH key  and press enter.
If you already have a public SSH key in AWS, provide its name here.
If you do not have it, generate a key pair with the following command:
  ssh-keygen
The public key defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and you can import with:
  aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name nuvolaris-key --public-key-material --region=<your-region> fileb://~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Just press enter for default [devkit-74s]: 

*** Please, specify AWS Image to use for VMs and press enter.
The suggested image is an Ubuntu 22 valid only for us-east-1
Please check AWS website for alternative images in other zones

Just press enter for default [ami-052efd3df9dad4825]: 

*** Please, specify AWS Default user for image to use for VMs and press enter.
Default user to access the selected image.

Just press enter for default [ubuntu]: 

*** Please, specify AWS Instance type to use for VMs and press enter.
The suggested instance type has 8GB and 2vcp
To get a list of valid values, use:
aws ec2 describe-instance-types --query 'InstanceTypes[].InstanceType' --output table

Just press enter for default [t3a.large]: 

*** Please, specify AWS Disk Size to use for VMs and press enter.
Just press enter for default [100]:

[#provision]
== Provision a server

You can provision one or more servers using `nuv`. The servers will use the parameters you have just configured.

You can create a new server with:

----
nuv cloud aws vm-create <server-name>
----

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Replace `<server-name>` with a name you choose, for example `nuvolaris-server`
=====

The command will create a new server in AWS with the parameters you specified in configuration.

You can also:

. list servers you created with `nuv cloud aws vm-list`
. delete a server you created and you do not need anymore with `nuv cloud aws delete <server-name>`

[#retrieve-ip]
== Retrieve IP

The server will be provisioned with an IP address assigned by AWS.

You can read the IP address of your server with 

----
nuv cloud aws vm-getip <server-name>
----
