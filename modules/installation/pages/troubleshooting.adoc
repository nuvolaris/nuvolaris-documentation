= Troubleshooting

This document gives you hints for solving issues, using the (hidden) subcommand `debug`.

Note it is technical and assumes you have some knowledge of how Kubernetes operates.

== Watching

While installing, you can watch the installation (opening another terminal) with the command:

----
nuv debug watch
----

Check that no pods will go in error while deploying.


== Configuration

You can inspect the configuration with the `nuv debug subcommand`

* API host: `nuv debug apihost`
* Static Configuration: `nuv debug config`. 
* Current Status : `nuv debug status`
* Runtimes: `nuv debug runtimes`
* Load Balancer: `nuv debug lb`
* Images: `nuv debug images`

== Logs

You can inspect logs with `nuv debug log` subcommand. Logs you can show:

* operator: `nuv debug log operator` (continuosly: `nuv debug log foperator`)
* controller: `nuv debug log controller` (continuosly: `nuv debug log fcontroller`)
* database: `nuv debug log couchdb` (continuosly: `nuv debug log fcouchdb`)
* certificate manager: database: `nuv debug log certman` (continuosly: `nuv debug log fcertmap`)

== Kubernetes

You can detect which Kubernetes are you using with:

`nuv debug detect`

You can then inspect Kubernetes objects with:

* namespaces: `nuv debug kube ns`
* nodes: `nuv debug kube nodes`
* pod: `nuv debug kube pod`
* services: `nuv debug kube svc`
* users: `nuv debug kube users`


You can enter in a pod by name (use `kube pod` to find the name) with:

----
nuv debug kube exec P=<pod-name>
----

== Kubeconfig

Usually `nuv` uses an hidden kubeconfig so does not override your kubernetes configuration.

If you want to go more in depth and you are knowledegeable of Kubernetes, 
you can export the kubeconfig with `nuv debug export F=<file>`.

You can *overwrite your kubeconfig* (be aware there is no backup) with `nuv debug export F=-`.
