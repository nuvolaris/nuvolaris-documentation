= About Nuvolaris Community

Nuvolaris Community is an Open Source project, released under the https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris/blob/main/LICENSE[Apache License 2.0] providing a portable and complete https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html[Serverless] environment, allowing to build quickly and easily cloud-native applications.

Our goal is to make Nuvolaris *ubitiquous*, allowing it to easily run a complete and portable environment that runs in every https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]. 

Nuvolaris is based on https://openwhisk.apache.org[Apache OpenWhisk], which provides a powerful, production-ready serverless engine.

However, the serverless engine is just the beginning, because a serverless environment requires a set of integrated services.

Nuvolaris provides integrated with OpenWhisk several additional services such as databases, object storage, and a cron scheduler.

Furthermore, we test it on many public cloud Kubernetes services and on-premises Kubernetes vendors.

The platform is paired with a powerful CLI tool, `nuv`, which lets you deploy Nuvolaris quickly and easily everywhere, and perform a lot of development tasks.

Our goal is to build a *complete* distribution of a serverless environment with the following features:

* It is easy to install and manage.
* Integrates all the key services to build applications.
* It is as portable as possible to run potentially in every Kubernetes.
* It is however tested regularly against a set of supported Kubernetes environments.
