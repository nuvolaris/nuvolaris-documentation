Download your version from this page, then install it according to the procedures of your operating system.

In all the operating systems with a graphical user interface, you can just double clicking on the installer to install it.

[NOTE]
==== 
beta version is currently unsigned. Check https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Software-from-Unsigned-Developers-on-a-Mac[here for install on Mac].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once installed, in the first run `nuv` will tell to update the tasks executing:
 
`nuv -update`

This command updates the Nuvolaris "tasks" (its internal logic) to the latest version. This command should be also executed frequently, as the tasks are continuously evolving and expanding.

`nuv` will suggest when to update them (at least once a day).

You normally just need to update the tasks but sometimes you also need to update `nuv` itself. The system will detect when it is the case and tell you what to do.
