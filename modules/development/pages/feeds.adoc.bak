== Implementing feeds

OpenWhisk supports an open API, where any user can expose an event
producer service as a *feed* in a *package*. This section describes
architectural and implementation options for providing your own feed.

This material is intended for advanced OpenWhisk users who intend to
publish their own feeds. Most OpenWhisk users can safely skip this
section.

== Feed Architecture

There are at least 3 architectural patterns for creating a feed:
*Hooks*, *Polling* and *Connections*.

=== Hooks

In the _Hooks_ pattern, we set up a feed using a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook[webhook] facility exposed by
another service. In this strategy, we configure a webhook on an external
service to POST directly to a URL to fire a trigger. This is by far the
easiest and most attractive option for implementing low-frequency feeds.

=== Polling

In the ``Polling'' pattern, we arrange for an OpenWhisk _action_ to poll
an endpoint periodically to fetch new data. This pattern is relatively
easy to build, but the frequency of events will of course be limited by
the polling interval.

=== Connections

In the ``Connections'' pattern, we stand up a separate service somewhere
that maintains a persistent connection to a feed source. The connection
based implementation might interact with a service endpoint via long
polling, or to set up a push notification.

== Difference between Feed and Trigger

Feeds and triggers are closely related, but technically distinct
concepts.

* OpenWhisk processes *events* which flow into the system.
* A *trigger* is technically a name for a class of events. Each event
belongs to exactly one trigger; by analogy, a trigger resembles a
_topic_ in topic-based pub-sub systems. A *rule* _T -> A_ means
"whenever an event from trigger _T_ arrives, invoke action _A_ with the
trigger payload.
* A *feed* is a stream of events which all belong to some trigger _T_. A
feed is controlled by a *feed action* which handles creating, deleting,
pausing, and resuming the stream of events which comprise a feed. The
feed action typically interacts with external services which produce the
events, via a REST API that manages notifications.

== Implementing Feed Actions

The _feed action_ is a normal OpenWhisk _action_, but it should accept
the following parameters: * *lifecycleEvent*: one of `CREATE', `READ',
`UPDATE', `DELETE', `PAUSE', or `UNPAUSE'. * *triggerName*: the
fully-qualified name of the trigger which contains events produced from
this feed. * *authKey*: the Basic auth credentials of the OpenWhisk user
who owns the trigger just mentioned.

The feed action can also accept any other parameters it needs to manage
the feed. For example the cloudant changes feed action expects to
receive parameters including _`dbname'_, _`username'_, etc.

When the user creates a trigger from the CLI with the *–feed* parameter,
the system automatically invokes the feed action with the appropriate
parameters.

For example,assume the user has created a `mycloudant` binding for the
`cloudant` package with their username and password as bound parameters.
When the user issues the following command from the CLI:

`wsk trigger create T --feed mycloudant/changes -p dbName myTable`

then under the covers the system will do something equivalent to:

`wsk action invoke mycloudant/changes -p lifecycleEvent CREATE -p triggerName T -p authKey <userAuthKey> -p password <password value from mycloudant binding> -p username <username value from mycloudant binding> -p dbName mytype`

The feed action named _changes_ takes these parameters, and is expected
to take whatever action is necessary to set up a stream of events from
Cloudant, with the appropriate configuration, directed to the trigger
_T_.

For the Cloudant _changes_ feed, the action happens to talk directly to
a _cloudant trigger_ service we’ve implemented with a connection-based
architecture. We’ll discuss the other architectures below.

A similar feed action protocol occurs for `wsk trigger delete`,
`wsk trigger update` and `wsk trigger get`.

== Implementing Feeds with Hooks

It is easy to set up a feed via a hook if the event producer supports a
webhook/callback facility.

With this method there is _no need_ to stand up any persistent service
outside of OpenWhisk. All feed management happens naturally though
stateless OpenWhisk _feed actions_, which negotiate directly with a
third part webhook API.

When invoked with `CREATE`, the feed action simply installs a webhook
for some other service, asking the remote service to POST notifications
to the appropriate `fireTrigger` URL in OpenWhisk.

The webhook should be directed to send notifications to a URL such as:

`POST /namespaces/{namespace}/triggers/{triggerName}`

The form with the POST request will be interpreted as a JSON document
defining parameters on the trigger event. OpenWhisk rules pass these
trigger parameters to any actions to fire as a result of the event.

== Implementing Feeds with Polling

It is possible to set up an OpenWhisk _action_ to poll a feed source
entirely within OpenWhisk, without the need to stand up any persistent
connections or external service.

For feeds where a webhook is not available, but do not need high-volume
or low latency response times, polling is an attractive option.

To set up a polling-based feed, the feed action takes the following
steps when called for `CREATE`:

[arabic]
. The feed action sets up a periodic trigger (_T_) with the desired
frequency, using the `whisk.system/alarms` feed.
. The feed developer creates a `pollMyService` action which simply polls
the remote service and returns any new events.
. The feed action sets up a _rule_ _T -> pollMyService_.

This procedure implements a polling-based trigger entirely using
OpenWhisk actions, without any need for a separate service.

== Implementing Feeds via Connections

The previous 2 architectural choices are simple and easy to implement.
However, if you want a high-performance feed, there is no substitute for
persistent connections and long-polling or similar techniques.

Since OpenWhisk actions must be short-running, an action cannot maintain
a persistent connection to a third party . Instead, we must stand up a
separate service (outside of OpenWhisk) that runs all the time. We call
these _provider services_. A provider service can maintain connections
to third party event sources that support long polling or other
connection-based notifications.

The provider service should provide a REST API that allows the OpenWhisk
_feed action_ to control the feed. The provider service acts as a proxy
between the event provider and OpenWhisk – when it receives events from
the third party, it sends them on to OpenWhisk by firing a trigger.

The Cloudant _changes_ feed is the canonical example – it stands up a
`cloudanttrigger` service which mediates between Cloudant notifications
over a persistent connection, and OpenWhisk triggers.

The _alarm_ feed is implemented with a similar pattern.

The connection-based architecture is the highest performance option, but
imposes more overhead on operations compared to the polling and hook
architectures.
