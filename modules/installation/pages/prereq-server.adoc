You can:
* get a server on any cloud provider or even install by yourself and then xref:prereq-server-generic.adoc[configure it]
* provision such a server with `nuv` xref:prereq-server-aws.adoc[on Amazon Web Services]
* provision such a server with `nuv` on xref:prereq-server-gcp.adoc[on Google Cloud Platform]


Optionally (it is not required) install xref:prereq-k3s.adoc[K3S] or xref:prereq-mk8s.adoc[MicroK8S] in it.

For information on how to open the firewall, please consult the documentation of your cloud provider or contact your system administrator, as there are no common procedures and they depends on the cloud provider.
