== Development

As mentioned in xref:environment.adoc[environment], MastroGPT offers a complete developer suite with functions and capabilities.

To start using it, simply click on `IDE` in your Admin environment at https://nuvolaris.dev and choose a starter point to explore MastroGPT architecture.

In this example, we'll see a Wordpress demo, a simplified nuvolaris environment from which you can develop both your backend functions and frontend HTML/CSS/JS files.

=== Choose Your Starter from IDE

image::IdeStarters.png["IdeStarters",align="center"]

When you click on one of these starters (which you can see as ready-to-use templates), nuv will redirect you to a web IDE with a devcontainer inside, from which you can edit code and test it directly!

== OpenAI Integration

OpenAI is already integrated for every starter template. An API key is available by default (with some limits) for each user.

When you need to use it, in your action file inside every package, simply insert in the first lines `--param` as in this example: 

----
#--web true
#--param OPENAI_API_KEY $OPENAI_API_KEY
#--param OPENAI_API_HOST $OPENAI_API_HOST

from  openai import AzureOpenAI

def main(args):
   key = args["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
   host = args["OPENAI_API_HOST"]
   AI = AzureOpenAI(api_version="2023-05-15", api_key=key, azure_endpoint=host)


   data = AI.models.list().model_dump()
   models = [m['id'] for m in data['data']]
   return { "models": models }
----

=== Development

image::webIde1.png["WebIde1",align="center"]

Once inside the web IDE, you'll be prompted to enter `Task devel` or `Task deploy` via CLI. Task devel is a nuv feature that will create packages, actions, and web content (placed into the web folder) into your nuvolaris environment. 

So, if you enter `Task devel` or `devel`, a devcontainer will start and you'll see the output of this code immediately via the browser.

=== Requirements

image::Requirements.png["Requirements",align="center"]

Inside the packages folder, you can place a file called `requirements.txt` which will be used to install your needed libraries. 
Here's a simple example:

----
farm-haystack
requests
----

=== Params

As packages need libraries, actions need parameters.

The naming convention to use a parameter is: #--param {paramName} {envParamName}

Some parameters are available by default inside nuv .env file. To use these parameters, remember to specify them inside every single action, as shown here:

----
#--web true
#--param OPENAI_API_KEY $OPENAI_API_KEY
#--param OPENAI_API_HOST $OPENAI_API_HOST

from openai import AzureOpenAI
import re

MODEL = "gpt-35-turbo"
AI = None

def req(msg):
    return [{"role": "system", "content": ROLE}, 
            {"role": "user", "content": msg}]

def ask(input):
    comp = AI.chat.completions.create(model=MODEL, messages=req(input))
    if len(comp.choices) > 0:
        content = comp.choices[0].message.content
        return content
    return "ERROR"

        res['output'] = output

    return {"body": res }

----

If your action includes in the first line a `#--web true` parameter, the action will be available online via HTTPS, both inside and outside nuvolaris environment. In this way, you can deploy your site as needed. 

=== Utils

To improve user development, MastroGPT offers some util features. For example, every time your source code changes, it will be immediately available thanks to a scanner that observes your code and notifies changes on your dev environment.

=== Web and Packages Folders

image::webFolder.png["webFolder",align="center"]

image::packagesFolder.png["packagesFolder",align="center"]

The `packages` folder contains your server-side code. There, you can deploy and publish your actions.

Inside the `web` folder, you can place every HTML/CSS/JS file that you need to build your own site or web app. If you use some framework single-page application, like Angular, React, Svelte, remember to copy the content of the build folder (after `npm run build` or similar) into the `web` folder.

So, if your index.html needs to call via index.js a backend action, simply call the URL of your action here, and your platform will be entirely available.

To make available on your nuvolaris env, see xref:deploy.adoc[deploy]
