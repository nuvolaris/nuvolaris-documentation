= Install on an Hetzner Cloud single instance

You can install Nuvolaris on a single Hetzner Cloud instance.

You need at least 4GB, 30GB disk space and 2 VCPU.

As a prerequisite, you need to get access to the https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects[Hetzner Cloud Console] by registering to Hetzner.

Before starting you need also to:

* create a new project
* enter in the project and create an ssh key

Once you got access to the console and performed the steps before, use the following instructions to lauch a suitable virtual machine and install Nuvolaris in it.

== Launch an Hetzner Virtual Machine

. Select your preferred location.
. Select Ubuntu 20+ as a distribution.
. Select standard or Dedicated for better performance
. Use the default.
. Use the default.
. Use the default.
. Use the default.
. Select your ssh key here and download it.
. Give it a name, for example `nuvolaris``

You are ready. Click on _Create and Buy Now_.

After the creation it will show the `<ip-address>` of your machine.

Access the machine with:

----
ssh -i <key-file> root@<ip-address>
----

== Install Nuvolaris

Once you are connected to the virtual machine with ssh, you can install Nuvolaris executing:

----
curl -s https://www.nuvolaris.io/scripts/ubuntu.sh | bash
----

The script will take a while to install Kubernetes and Nuvolaris.

If something goes wrong, please check the xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting] page.

At the end it will show  a command like this:

----
nuv wskprops --apihost=<apihost> --auth=<auth>
----

where `<apihost>` is the DNS name of your virtual machine and `<auth>` is the authorization key.

Take note of this command. You will need it to configure access to your serverless environemnt from anywhere using this command.

You can then install the `nuv` command in your favorite client machine, https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris/releases[downloading] the correct version and use the command before to connect to your instance.

Once the installation is completed, proceed reading https://openwhisk.apache.org/documentation.html[Apache OpenWhisk documentation], remembering to use `nuv wsk` when you see `wsk`.
