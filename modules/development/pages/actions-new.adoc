== Adding Action Language Runtimes

OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris supports link:index-runtimes.adoc[several
languages and runtimes] but there may be other languages or runtimes
that are important for your organization, and for which you want tighter
integration with the platform. The OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform is extensible and
you can add new languages or runtimes (with custom packages and
third-party dependencies) following the guide described here.

=== Runtime general requirements

The unit of execution for all functions is a
https://docs.docker.com[Docker container] which must implement a
specific link:#action-interface[Action interface] that, in general
performs:

[arabic]
. *link:#initialization[Initialization]* - accepts an initialization
payload (the code) and prepared for execution,
. *link:#activation[Activation]* - accepts a runtime payload (the input
parameters) and
* prepares the activation context,
* runs the function,
* returns the function result,
. *link:#logging[Logging]* - flushes all `stdout` and `stderr` logs and
adds a frame marker at the end of the activation.

The specifics of the link:#action-interface[Action interface] and its
functions are shown below.

=== Platform requirements

In order for your language runtime to be properly recognized by the
OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform, and officially recognized by the Apache OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris
project, please follow these requirements and best practices:

[arabic]
. Implement the runtime in its own repository to permit a management
lifecycle independent of the rest of the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform.
. Introduce the runtime specification into the
link:../ansible/files/runtimes.json[runtimes manifest],
. Add the runtime to the
link:../core/controller/src/main/resources/apiv1swagger.json[Swagger
file]
. Add a new `actions-<your runtime>.md` file to the link:.[docs]
directory,
. Add a link to your new runtime doc to the
link:actions.md#languages-and-runtimes[top level actions index].
. Add a standard link:#the-test-action[test action] to the
link:../tests/dat/actions/unicode.tests[tests artifacts directory] (as
shown below),

The new runtime repository should conform to the
link:#canonical-runtime-repository[Canonical runtime repository] layout
(as shown below). Further, you should automate and pass the following
test suites: - link:#action-interface-tests[Action Interface tests] -
link:#runtime-proxy-tests[Runtime proxy tests]

=== The runtimes manifest

Actions when created specify the desired runtime for the function via a
property called ``kind''. When using the `nuv` CLI, this is specified as
`--kind <runtime-kind>`. The value is typically a string describing the
language (e.g., `nodejs`) followed by a colon and the version for the
runtime as in `nodejs:20` or `php:8.1`.

The manifest is a map of runtime family names to an array of specific
kinds. The details of the schema are found in the
link:../common/scala/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/entity/ExecManifest.scala[Exec
Manifest]. As an example, the following entry add a new runtime family
called `nodejs` with a single kind `nodejs:20`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "nodejs": [{
    "kind": "nodejs:20",
    "default": true,
    "image": {
      "prefix": "openwhisk",
      "name": "action-nodejs-v20",
      "tag": "latest"
    }
  }]
}
----

The `default` property indicates if the corresponding kind should be
treated as the default for the runtime family. The JSON `image`
structure defines the Docker image name that is used for actions of this
kind (e.g., `openwhisk/nodejs10action:latest` for the JSON example
above).

=== Canonical runtime repository

The runtime repository should follow the canonical structure used by
other runtimes.

....
/path/to/runtime
├── build.gradle         # Gradle build file to integrate with rest of build and test framework
├── core
│   └── <runtime name and version>
│       ├── Dockerfile   # builds the runtime's Docker image
│       └── ...          # your runtimes files which implement the action proxy
└── tests
    └── src              # tests suits...
        └── ...          # ... which extend canonical interface plus additional runtime specific tests
....

The https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-docker[Docker skeleton
repository] is an example starting point to fork and modify for your new
runtime.

=== The test action

The standard test action is shown below in JavaScript. It should be
adapted for the new language and added to the
link:../tests/dat/actions/unicode.tests[test artifacts directory] with
the name `<runtime-kind>.txt` for plain text file or
`<runtime-kind>.bin` for a a binary file. The `<runtime-kind>` must
match the value used for `kind` in the corresponding runtime manifest
entry, replacing `:` in the kind with a `-`. For example, a plain text
function for `nodejs:20` becomes `nodejs-20.txt`.

[source,js]
----
function main(args) {
    var str = args.delimiter + " ☃ " + args.delimiter;
    console.log(str);
    return { "winter": str };
}
----

=== Action Interface

An action consists of the user function (and its dependencies) along
with a _proxy_ that implements a canonical protocol to integrate with
the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform.

The proxy is a web server with two endpoints. * It listens on port
`8080`. * It implements `/init` to initialize the container. * It also
implements `/run` to activate the function.

The proxy also prepares the
link:actions.md#accessing-action-metadata-within-the-action-body[execution
context], and flushes the logs produced by the function to stdout and
stderr.

==== Initialization

The initialization route is `/init`. It must accept a `POST` request
with a JSON object as follows:

....
{
  "value": {
    "name" : String,
    "main" : String,
    "code" : String,
    "binary": Boolean,
    "env": Map[String, String]
  }
}
....

* `name` is the name of the action.
* `main` is the name of the function to execute.
* `code` is either plain text or a base64 encoded string for binary
functions (i.e., a compiled executable).
* `binary` is false if `code` is in plain text, and true if `code` is
base64 encoded.
* `env` is a map of key-value pairs of properties to export to the
environment. And contains several properties starting with the `__OW_`
prefix that are specific to the running action.
** `__OW_API_KEY` the API key for the subject invoking the action, this
key may be a restricted API key. This property is absent unless
explicitly link:./annotations.md#annotations-for-all-actions[requested].
** `__OW_NAMESPACE` the namespace for the _activation_ (this may not be
the same as the namespace for the action).
** `__OW_ACTION_NAME` the fully qualified name of the running action.
** `__OW_ACTION_VERSION` the internal version number of the running
action.
** `__OW_ACTIVATION_ID` the activation id for this running action
instance.
** `__OW_DEADLINE` the approximate time when this initializer will have
consumed its entire duration quota (measured in epoch milliseconds).

The initialization route is called exactly once by the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris
platform, before executing a function. The route should report an error
if called more than once. It is possible however that a single
initialization will be followed by many activations (via `/run`). If an
`env` property is provided, the corresponding environment variables
should be defined before the action code is initialized.

*Successful initialization:* The route should respond with `200 OK` if
the initialization is successful and the function is ready to execute.
Any content provided in the response is ignored.

*Failures to initialize:* Any response other than `200 OK` is treated as
an error to initialize. The response from the handler if provided must
be a JSON object with a single field called `error` describing the
failure. The value of the error field may be any valid JSON value. The
proxy should make sure to generate meaningful log message on failure to
aid the end user in understanding the failure.

*Time limit:* Every action in OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris has a defined time limit (e.g.,
60 seconds). The initialization must complete within the allowed
duration. Failure to complete initialization within the allowed time
frame will destroy the container.

*Limitation:* The proxy does not currently receive any of the activation
context at initialization time. There are scenarios where the context is
convenient if present during initialization. This will require a change
in the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform itself. Note that even if the context is
available during initialization, it must be reset with every new
activation since the information will change with every execution.

==== Activation

The proxy is ready to execute a function once it has successfully
completed initialization. The OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform will invoke the
function by posting an HTTP request to `/run` with a JSON object
providing a new activation context and the input parameters for the
function. There may be many activations of the same function against the
same proxy (viz. container). Currently, the activations are guaranteed
not to overlap — that is, at any given time, there is at most one
request to `/run` from the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform.

The route must accept a JSON object and respond with a JSON object,
otherwise the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform will treat the activation as a failure
and proceed to destroy the container. The JSON object provided by the
platform follows the following schema:

....
{
  "value": JSON,
  "namespace": String,
  "action_name": String,
  "api_host": String,
  "api_key": String,
  "activation_id": String,
  "transaction_id": String,
  "deadline": Number
}
....

* `value` is a JSON object and contains all the parameters for the
function activation.
* `namespace` is the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris namespace for the action (e.g.,
`whisk.system`).
* `action_name` is the link:reference.md#fully-qualified-names[fully
qualified name] of the action.
* `activation_id` is a unique ID for this activation.
* `transaction_id` is a unique ID for the request of which this
activation is part of.
* `deadline` is the deadline for the function.
* `api_key` is the API key used to invoke the action.

The `value` is the function parameters. The rest of the properties
become part of the activation context which is a set of environment
variables constructed by capitalizing each of the property names, and
prefixing the result with `__OW_`. Additionally, the context must define
`__OW_API_HOST` whose value is the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris API host. This value is
currently provided as an environment variable defined at container
startup time and hence already available in the context.

*Successful activation:* The route must respond with `200 OK` if the
activation is successful and the function has produced a JSON object as
its result. The response body is recorded as the
link:actions.md#understanding-the-activation-record[result of the
activation].

*Failed activation:* Any response other than `200 OK` is treated as an
activation error. The response from the handler must be a JSON object
with a single field called `error` describing the failure. The value of
the error field may be any valid JSON value. Should the proxy fail to
respond with a JSON object, the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform will treat the
failure as an uncaught exception. These two failures modes are
distinguished by the value of the `response.status` in the
link:actions.md#understanding-the-activation-record[activation record]
which is ``application error'' if the proxy returned an ``error''
object, and ``action developer error'' otherwise.

*Time limit:* Every action in OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris has a defined time limit (e.g.,
60 seconds). The activation must complete within the allowed duration.
Failure to complete activation within the allowed time frame will
destroy the container.

==== Logging

The proxy must flush all the logs produced during initialization and
execution and add a frame marker to denote the end of the log stream for
an activation. This is done by emitting the token
https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/59abfccf91b58ee39f184030374203f1bf372f2d/core/invoker/src/main/scala/whisk/core/containerpool/docker/DockerContainer.scala#L51[`XXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX`]
as the last log line for the `stdout` _and_ `stderr` streams. Failure to
emit this marker will cause delayed or truncated activation logs.

=== Testing

==== Action Interface tests

The link:#action-interface[Action interface] is enforced via a
link:../tests/src/test/scala/actionContainers/BasicActionRunnerTests.scala[canonical
test suite] which validates the initialization protocol, the runtime
protocol, ensures the activation context is correctly prepared, and that
the logs are properly framed. Your runtime should extend this test
suite, and of course include additional tests as needed.

==== Runtime proxy tests

There is a
link:../tests/src/test/scala/actionContainers/BasicActionRunnerTests.scala[canonical
test harness] for validating a new runtime.

The tests verify that the proxy can handle the following scenarios: *
Test the proxy can handle the identity functions (initialize and run). *
Test the proxy can handle pre-defined environment variables as well as
initialization parameters. * Test the proxy properly constructs the
activation context. * Test the proxy can properly handle functions with
Unicode characters. * Test the proxy can handle large payloads (more
than 1MB). * Test the proxy can handle an entry point other than
``main''. * Test the proxy does not permit re-initialization. * Test the
error handling for an action returning an invalid response. * Test the
proxy when initialized with no content.

The canonical test suite should be extended by the new runtime tests.
Additional tests will be required depending on the feature set provided
by the runtime.

Since the OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris platform is language and runtime agnostic, it is
generally not necessary to add integration tests. That is the unit tests
verifying the protocol are sufficient. However, it may be necessary in
some cases to modify the `nuv` CLI or other OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris clients. In which
case, appropriate tests should be added as necessary. The OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris
platform will perform a generic integration test as part of its basic
system tests. This integration test will require a
link:#the-test-action[test function] to be available so that the test
harness can create, invoke, and delete the action.

=== Supporting Additional Execution Environments

There are now several runtimes that support execution environments in
addition to OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris. Currently only an interface for single entrypoint
execution environments has been defined, but more could be defined in
the future.

==== Action Proxy Single Entrypoint Interface

Single entrypoint proxies are proxies that have only onde addressable
http endpoint. They do not use `/init` and `/run` enpoints utilized by
standard OpenWhisk and Nuvolaris runtime environments; instead both the initialization
and activation are handled through one endpoint. The first example of
such a proxy was implemented for Knative Serving, but the same interface
can be used for any single entrypoint execution environment. In an
effort to standardize how the various action proxy implementation
containers are able to handle single entrypoint execution environments
(such as Knative Serving), there is a description of the contract and
example cases outlining how a container should respond with a given
input. The descriptions and example cases are documented in
link:single_entrypoint_proxy_contract.md[Single Entrypoint Proxy
Contract].
