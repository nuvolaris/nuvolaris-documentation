= Provision a Linux Server in Google Cloud

You can provision a server suitable to install Nuvolaris in cloud providerhttps://cloud.google.com/gcp[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)] as follows:

. install the <<install-cli, GCloud CLI>>
. <<configure, configure GKE>>
. <<provision, provision a server>>
. retrieve the <<retrieve-ip, ip address>> to configure a DNS name

Once you have Linux server up and running you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring] and xref:install-cluster.adoc[installing Nuvolaris].

[#install-cli]
== Installing the GCloud CLI

Our cli `nuv` uses under the hood the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud[GCloud CLI version 2], so you need to dowload and install it https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[following those instructions].

Once installed, ensure it is available on the terminal executing the following command:

----
gcloud version
----

you should receive something like this:

====
`
Google Cloud SDK 443.0.0
beta 2023.08.11
bq 2.0.96
bundled-python3-unix 3.9.16
core 2023.08.11
gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin 0.5.5
gsutil 5.25
`
====

[#configure]
== Configuring GKE to provision a server

Before you can provision a Linux server you have to configure AWS typing the command:

----
nuv config gcloud
----

The system will then ask the following questions:

----
*** Please, specify GCloud Project Id and press enter.
nuvolaris
*** Please, specify GCloud Zone and press enter.
To get a list of valid values use:
  gcloud compute zones list

Just press enter for default [us-east1-d]: 

*** Please, specify GCloud virtual machine type and press enter.
To get a list of valid values, use:
  gcloud compute machine-types list

Just press enter for default [n2-standard-4]: 

*** Please, specify GCloud disk size in gigabyte and press enter.
Just press enter for default [200]: 

*** Please, specify GCloud public SSH key and press enter.
If you already have a public SSH key provide its path here. If you do not have it, generate a key pair with the following command:
  ssh-keygen
The public key defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Just press enter for default [/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub]: 

----

[#provision]
== Provision a server

You can provision one or more servers  using `nuv`. The servers will use the parameters you have just configured.

You can create a new server with:

----
nuv cloud gcloud vm-create <server-name>
----

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Replace `<server-name>` with a name you choose, for example `nuvolaris-server`
=====

The command will create a new server in Google CLoud with the parameters you specified in configuration.

You can also:

. list servers you created with `nuv cloud gcloud vm-list`
. delete a server you created and you do not need anymore with `nuv cloud gcloud vm-delete <server-name>`

[#retrieve-ip]
== Retrieve IP

The server will be provisioned with an IP address assigned by Google Cloud.

You can read the IP address of your server with 

----
nuv cloud gcloud vm-getip <server-name>
----

You need this IP when xref:configure-dns.adoc[configuring a DNS name] for the server.
