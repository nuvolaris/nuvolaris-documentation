= Kubernetes Cluster requirements

Nuvolaris installs in any Kubernetes cluster which satisfies the following requirements:

- `cluster-admin` access
- at least 3 worker nodes with 4GB of memory each
- support for block storage configured as default storage class
- support for LoadBalancer services 
- the https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx[nginx ingress] already installed
- the https://cert-manager.io/[cert manager] already installed

Once you have such a cluster, you need to retrieve the IP address of the Load Balancer associated with the Nginx Ingress.  In the default installation, it is installed in the namespace `nginx-ingress` and it is called `ingress-nginx-controller`.

In the default installation you can read the IP address with the following command:

----
kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc ingress-nginx-controller
----

If you have installed it in some other namespace or with another name, change the command accordingly.

The result should be something like this:

----
`NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.0.9.99    20.62.156.19   80:30898/TCP,443:31451/TCP   4d1h
----

Take note of the value under **EXTERNAL-IP** as  you need it in the next step of installation, xref:configure-dns.adoc[configuring DNS].
