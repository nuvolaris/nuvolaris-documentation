= Configure a generic Linux server to install Nuvolaris 

Read below for information how to create a <<sshkey, sshkey>> and <<sudo, configure sudo>>

[#sshkey]
== Installing a Public SSH key

To connect to a server without a password using `openssh` (used by the installer), you need a couple of files called **ssh keys**.

You can generate them on the command line using this command:

----
ssh-keygen
----

It will create a couple of files, typically called:

* `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
* `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

where `~` is your home directory.

You have to keep secret the `id_rsa` file because it is the private key and contains the information to identify you uniquely. Think to is as your password.

You can copy the `id_rsa.pub` in the server or even share it publicly, as it is the public key. Think to it as your login name, and adding this file to the server adds you to the  users who can login into it.

Once you have generated the public key, access your server, then edit the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` adding the public key to it.

It is just one line, contained in the `id_rsa.pub` file.   

Create the file if it does not exist. Append the line to the file (as a single line) if it already exists. Do not remove  other lines if you do not want to remove access to other users.

[#sudo]
== Configure SUDO

You normally access Linux servers using a user that is *not* `root` (the system administrator with unlimited power on the system). 

Depending on the system, the user to use to access  be `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, `admin` or something else entirely. However if you have access to the server, the information of which user to use should have been provided, including a way to access to the `root` user.

You need to give this user the right to execute commands as `root` without a password, and you do this by configuring the command `sudo`.

You usually have either access to root with the `su` command, or you can execute `sudo` with a password.

Type either `su` or `sudo bash` to become root and edit the file `/etc/sudoers` adding the following line:

----
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
----
 
where `<user>` is the user you use to log into the system.
