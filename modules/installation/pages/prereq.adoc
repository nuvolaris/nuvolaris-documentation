= Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris

This page lists the prerequisites to install Nuvolaris in various environments.

You can install Nuvolaris:

* for **development** in a <<single-node, single node>> environment, either in your local machine or in a Linux server.
* for **production**, in a <<multi-node, multi node>> environment provided by a Kubernetes cluster.

[#single-node]
== Single Node development installation

For **development** purposes, you can install a single node Nuvolaris deployment in the following environments as soon as the following requirements are satisfied:

* To install in your xref:install-local.adoc[local machine], you need xref:prereq-docker.adoc[Docker Desktop] 
* To install in a *single node* xref:install-server.adoc[Linux server],  you need a xref:prereq-server.adoc[Linux server] accessible with SSH.

Our installer can automatically install a Kubernetes environment, using https://k3s.io[K3S], but if you prefer you can install a single-node Kubernetes instance by yourself.

If you choose to install Kubernetes on your server, we provide support for:

* xref:prereq-k3s.adoc[SuSE K3S] 
* xref:prereq-mk8s.adoc[Canonical MicroK8S]

[#multi-node]
== Multi Node production installation

For **production** purposes, you need a multi-node Kubernetes cluster that satisfies xref:prereq-kubernetes.adoc[those requirements], accessible with its `kubeconfig` file.

If you have such a cluster, you can  install  xref:install-cluster.adoc[Nuvolaris in a Kubernetes cluster]

If you do not have a cluster and you need to setup one, we provide support for provisioning a suitable cluster that satisfied our requirements for the following Kubernetes environments:

* xref:prereq-eks.adoc[EKS in Amazon AWS] 
* xref:prereq-aks.adoc[AKS in Microsoft Azure]
* xref:prereq-gke.adoc[GKE in Google Cloud]
* xref:prereq-osh.adoc[RedHat OpenShift] 

Once you have a suitable Kubernetes cluster, you can proceed xref:install.adoc[installing Nuvolaris].
